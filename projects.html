                <p>This is a web application that combines image processing capabilities with generative artificial intelligence to create textual image captions. It offers upload capabilities for image files and generate an output of multiple caption options tailored to the content of the images. Additionally, the application includes a natural language interface that allows users to modify generated captions based on any context, mood, or tone that they wish.</p>

                <p>Built a music playlist management app that allows users to import and sync playlists from external platforms like YouTube. The mobile app also allows users to listen to imported songs with a built-in media player. This was a personal project of mine.</p>
